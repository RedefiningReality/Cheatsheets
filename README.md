# Security Cheat Sheets and Guides
Originally a collection of all my personal cheat sheets and certification exam guides as I progress through my career in offensive security.
Now expanded to include all the resources I regularly consult and recommend.  
Also check out my [ohmykali terminal plugin](https://github.com/RedefiningReality/ohmykali) for Kali Linux.
